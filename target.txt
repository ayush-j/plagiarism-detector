Abstract: Background: This study was undertaken to investigate the effect of alkaloid extract of fenugreek dried seeds (Trigonella foenum-graecum L.) on blood glucose, serum insulin, serum lipid profile and lipid peroxidation in addition to histoliogical and histochemical study of liver and kidney in alloxan induced diabetic albino rats.

Methods: Alkaloid extract of fenugreek dried seeds was tested in alloxan induced hyperglycemic rats. It was administered orally (dose chosen according to LD50) for 21 days. Its effect on blood glucose, serum insulin, lipids (total cholesterol, triglycerides, HDL and LDL) and lipid peroxides (thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) and nitric oxide) were studied in diabetic rats. In addition to histoliogical and histochemical study of their liver and kidney.

Result: Treatment with alkaloid extract of fenugreek dried seeds, resulted in a significant reduction of blood glucose and increase in serum insulin. The herbal preparation also resulted in a significant decrease in serum lipids and lipid peroxide formation and helps to recover the pathological effects of diabetes on liver and kidney of alloxan induced diabetic rats.

Conclusion:We suggest here that the mode of action of fenugreek may be caused by their contents of alkaloids through reducing the increased blood glucose level, thereby npreventing hyperglycemia during diabetes and reducing lipid profile to almost normal and suppressing the oxidative stress together with converting liver and kidney pathology caused by diabetes to normal pattern.

Result2: Treatment with alkaloid extract of fenugreek dried seeds, resulted in a significant reduction of blood glucose and increase in serum insulin. The herbal preparation also resulted in a significant decrease in serum lipids and lipid peroxide formation and helps to recover the pathological effects of diabetes on liver and kidney of alloxan induced diabetic rats.
